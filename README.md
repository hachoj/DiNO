# DiNO Research

## What is this project

This project is my research work on Meta's DiNO models.

My goal with this project was to gain a better understanding of this new genre of unsupervised vision models using trasnformers.

To do this, I had to main goals: try to recreate the model from scratch and perform attention analysis.

I was able to do that as seen in the report.
